The premise of this round is simple: build and end to end application described in the problem statement in the set amount of time. At the end, you demo your product and explain the design choices you have made. You even discuss how you will approach some extensions and what else you could've worked on if you had more time. 

Problem Statement: 

We need to build a backend for the ride hailing platform like Uber. Come up with working runnable code for it.

Functional Requirements:

Register a user (M)
Register a driver (M)
Book a ride if any driver is available within a certain radius. (M)
Implement a tiered pricing strategy: one of the examples could be - (M)
Minimum ride price - 50 rs
First 2 KMs at 10 Rs / KM
3-5 KMs at 8 Rs / KM
6 KM and beyond at 5 rs / KM
Complete a ride and get the cost for it. (O)
Update location of a cab. (O)
Show ride history for a user: ongoing and completed rides. (O)
Show ride history for a driver: ongoing and completed rides. (O)

Your priorities should be:
Workable solution
Clean Code & Design 
Extensibility of the solution
